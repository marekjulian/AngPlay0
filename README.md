AngPlay0
========

A quick App to experiment with Angular features. A simple one page APP to track game player *rankings*, *active games*, and the current *king* (highest ranked player). We'll use Foosball to provide some real life context.

Simply:
  * git clone <this repo>
  * npm install
  * npm start
